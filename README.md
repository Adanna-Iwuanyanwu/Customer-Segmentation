## CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
The data i used for this analysis was gotten from https://absentdata.com/data-analysis/where-to-find-data/

## INTRODUCTION
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers with similar characteristics into discrete groups for the purpose of marketing or sales. We can use the RFM analysis to segment customers into different groups. RFM stands for Recency which means how recently a customer purchased an item, Frequency which means how frequently the customer patronises the business, and monetary which means the financial value of the customer to the business. The Frequency and Monetary value show the Customer Lifetime Value while the Recency measures retention and gives insights into retention and customer engagement.

## AIM OF THE ANALYSIS
The analysis was done to understand the buying behaviour of customers between 2010 and 2011 and to know the classification of customers based on their various segments.


## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
The steps below were taken to achieve the result of this analysis;
1.	Data Cleaning
2.	Customer Segmentation

4.	Insight and Recommendation
## DATA CLEANING
I used Power Query to clean and transformed the data. I removed some irrelevant columns that were not needed for this analysis and added the sales amount column.

## DATA VISUALIZATION

## INSIGHT AND RECOMMENDATION
The company made a total of $1,640,000 and sold a total of 976,000 items to its various customers. Over the years, the business added about 9.90% of new customers to its customer base.
After the segmentation, the analysis shows that the company has lost 11.75% of its customers with only 3.77% as the top customers and 25.91% of the customers needing immediate attention with 22.65% of the customers being at risk of leaving the company.
This shows that there is a downward patronage from the customers which might be due to various reasons such as; poor customer service, business negligence, lack of having the right products or not investing in proper digital and offline marketing campaigns.  
Most of the company's customers live in the United Kingdom and the most purchased goods are world war 2 gliders asstd designs. The Czech Republic is the country with the least customers and the peak period of sales for the company is in the month of November while January is the least period of sales for the company. 
This analysis further shows that the business is failing and proper management needs to be employed to rescue the business from going into rock bottom failure. 

Therefore, I recommend the management carry out a detailed customer survey to get honest feedback from the customers to understand the areas of the business that needs more improvement. Also, rebranding should be done to give the business a new facelift and glow to its prospective customers.
Other customers that are either hibernating, at risk or need immediate attention should be offered a discount on their next purchase and the company needs to reward its loyal customers for sticking with the business through their worst times.
The company needs to incorporate ways to reach out to its customers at intervals and introduce them to the new business process they have implemented this will give the customers a sense of importance and involvement towards the business.
