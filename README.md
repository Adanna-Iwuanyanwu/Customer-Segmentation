## INTRODUCTION
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers with similar characteristics into discrete groups for the purpose of marketing or sales. We can use the RFM analysis to segment customers into different groups. RFM stands for Recency which means how recently a customer purchased an item, Frequency which means how frequently the customer patronises the business, and monetary which means the financial value of the customer to the business. The Frequency and Monetary value show the Customer Lifetime Value while the Recency measures retention and gives insights into retention and customer engagement.
